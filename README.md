### 4.1_Spring_Framework_Basics_Level3

## Postman Exercise

This involves testing the previous projects from Postman.

Create two environments:

- Maven Project

- Gradle Project

Both environments will have two variables:

- Server, which in both cases will have the value http://localhost

- Port, which in the case of the Maven project will have the value 9000, and in the case of the Gradle project, 9001.

What do you have to deliver? (4 files):

- The two exported environments.

- A screenshot for each environment, where you can see the execution from Postman using the environment and the variables defined in them.

- You can test the URL: http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/elmeunom, or any other that the two projects support. (Remember that for the execution to work correctly, you must have both projects running in Eclipse).

Run the projects created in the two previous levels and show the return obtained in each project, when you call some of the available requests, using the created environments and their variables.

You will have to provide two screenshots, one for the execution of each environment, and two files in JSON format, with the exported environments.
